Said petition was apparently started by some Ms. Trần Ngọc Tuệ Mẫn - Student Council&#8217;s vice president. Well&#8230; yay for free speech, I guess? Anyway, my name was really among the signers&nbsp;list:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/rmitsc_02_names.png"></p> <p>How did this happen? Well, turns out <strong>iPetition does not require email confirmation upon signing</strong>, so anyone can effectively enter any email and name they want and the stupid website will happily accept that as an absolutely definitely most positively legit supporter of your cause. Cool&nbsp;huh?</p> <p>Upon further inspection, almost all of the signer names are in one same format: the one that <span class="caps">RMIT</span> uses for its student names. So apparently a very motivated supporter of Ms. Mẫn&#8217;s&#8230; interesting campaign has been helpful enough to go through <span class="caps">RMIT</span> students&#8217; IDs and names and sign us up, without us even having to know what it&#8217;s all about. Gee,&nbsp;thanks!</p> <h2>Why do I even&nbsp;care?</h2> <p>I just don&#8217;t like people using my name without my consent. More importantly, I have my reasons to disagree with the sentiments expressed in her petition description. Also I thought this could be a somewhat useful public service announcement, or a mildly entertaining daily wtf story. I don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p> <p>Hell, let&#8217;s throw in some of my own random thoughts to make this more like a blog&nbsp;post:</p> <ul> <li> <p>What&#8217;s with these petition websites? Have people actually achieved anything using these? Even if a petition website does send confirmation emails, what&#8217;s stopping me from using trash addresses? The signers&#8217; email addresses are not displayed anyway so president@rmit.edu.vn won&#8217;t be too different from lol0042@spam.me now, will it? If you&#8217;re an official co-leader of something official who wants to do something official about it, maybe try a more, I don&#8217;t know, official&nbsp;channel?</p> </li> <li> <p>The number of signers keep going up steadily, but slowly. Maybe our friendly neighborhood signerman is doing it all by hand instead of a script? If it&#8217;s the former&#8230; let&#8217;s say I do admire the dedication <strike>and abhor the absolute stupidity</strike>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it normal for a student council to be this full of&nbsp;drama?</p> </li> </ul> <p>That concludes my mostly pointless blog post. Hopefully I&#8217;ll come up with something actually worth sharing soon. Until then, have an awesome&nbsp;weekend!</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content --> </section> <footer id="contentinfo" class="body"> <address id="about" class="vcard body"> Proudly powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, which takes great advantage of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. </address><!-- /#about --> </footer><!-- /#contentinfo --> </body> </html>
