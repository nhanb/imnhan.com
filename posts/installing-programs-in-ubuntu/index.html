Fire up your favorite text editor and create a file called <code>itc.sh</code> with the following&nbsp;content:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>

notify-send <span class="s2">&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>Let&#8217;s say I put it at the desktop. Now open up a terminal, go to the Desktop directory and make our itc file executable. In case you&#8217;re new, here are the&nbsp;commands:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /home/your_username/Desktop
chmod +x itc.sh
</code></pre></div> <p><strong>Protip</strong>: for the first command you can also type <code>cd ~/Desktop</code>, because <code>~</code> is the shorthand for your home directory (<code>/home/username</code>)</p> <p>With the <code>chmod</code> command, we made it possible to run our little script by typing its full&nbsp;path:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>~/Desktop/itc.sh
</code></pre></div> <p>Another shorthand to make your life easier: <code>.</code> stands for &#8220;current directory&#8221;, meaning if you are currently in the <code>~/Desktop</code> directory, you can run the script by simply&nbsp;typing:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./itc.sh
</code></pre></div> <p>Either way, a notification saying &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; should pop up. This is a program in its simplest form: an executable file. In this particular example it is a Bash script, but it&#8217;s not limited to that. It can be a Python or Ruby script, or a compiled binary file. The file extension isn&#8217;t even needed. You can rename it to simply <code>itc</code> and it should run just&nbsp;fine.</p> <blockquote> <p>In order to run a file, you need to make it executable. This can be done with the <code>chmod</code> command or via the <span class="caps">GUI</span> <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/35478/how-do-i-mark-a-file-as-executable-via-a-gui">using Nautilus&#8217;s <strong>Properties</strong> dialog</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Path</h2> <p>So we&#8217;ve created a program that shows a useless message, good job! However, every time we call it, we need to specify the whole address to the file: <code>~/Desktop/itc</code> is probably not a very cool looking command. In order to make it possible to simply run <code>itc</code>, you need to move it to the <code>/usr/bin/</code> directory. This requires root permission so we&#8217;ll need <code>sudo</code> too:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo mv ~/Desktop/itc /usr/bin/itc
</code></pre></div> <p>We can now run our program by simply typing <code>itc</code>. You guessed it: every executable file put in this directory will be available as a command. There are other directories like this too. You can see a whole list of such directories by typing <code>echo $PATH</code> to your&nbsp;terminal.</p> <blockquote> <p>To make an executable file available as a command, shove it into a directory that&#8217;s included in <strong>$<span class="caps">PATH</span></strong></p> </blockquote> <h2>Packages</h2> <p>Unfortunately, most programs have a lot of files instead of one, and they are scattered to many different folders. Let&#8217;s have a look at the files of <code>wget</code> - the downloader that&#8217;s included in every major Linux&nbsp;distribution:</p> <p><img alt="Wget files" src="/images/wget-installed-files.png"></p> <p>It&#8217;s not that the developers chose to annoy us by scattering them all over the place. It&#8217;s simply complying to Linux structure: executable files go to <strong>/usr/bin</strong>, man pages (user manuals that show up when you type <code>man wget</code>) go to <strong>/usr/share/man</strong>, and so on. For more complex programs, the number of files alone is terrifying, which makes installing and remove the program a&nbsp;nightmare.</p> <p>On another note, almost every Linux program depends on one or many other programs. This is because of the <span class="caps">UNIX</span> philosophy that encourages writing each program to do one thing, and do it well. The goal is to make each program easier to implement and maintain as well as to avoid duplicate work. For example, program A may provide a functionality that both programs B and C need. Otherwise, B and C developers both have to write code for one same functionality. In this case, A is called a <strong>dependency</strong> of B and C. However, this introduces a bunch of&nbsp;problems:</p> <ul> <li>We need to install A before installing&nbsp;B</li> <li>We should know not to install A again when we install&nbsp;C</li> <li>We must be careful not to remove A if we are still using B or&nbsp;C</li> <li>What if B and C require different versions of&nbsp;A?</li> <li>I can go&nbsp;on&#8230;</li> </ul> <p>This is where packages jump in. A package is basically the whole set of files of a program (or a part of a program). It also stores necessary information such as which file goes to which directory, what are the dependencies of this package, etc. A special program reads the package, installs dependencies and puts files into their appropriate locations. This is called a <strong>package manager</strong>. Of course besides installing, a package manager also manages updates and removals of programs. Ubuntu is based on Debian, so it inherits Debian&#8217;s great package manager called <strong>aptitude</strong> (or simply <code>apt</code>). Let&#8217;s take a look at wget&#8217;s&nbsp;dependencies:</p> <p><img alt="Wget files" src="/images/wget-dependencies.png"></p> <p>The package manager maintains a list of available packages and their dependency/dependant relationships. For Ubuntu, the list is updated regularly on Canonical&#8217;s official servers. Everytime Ubuntu does the &#8220;Check for updates&#8221; thing, it is downloading the latest list of packages. And when Ubuntu updates, it is simply pulling newer versions of the installed packages from Canonical&#8217;s servers too. These servers are called <strong>repositories</strong>. All other major Linux distributions do the same thing: letting the package manager and the repositories work on their thing, saving users time to do more interesting&nbsp;stuff.</p> <p>Here are some basic commands to get you&nbsp;started:</p> <ul> <li><code>sudo apt-get install package-name</code> to install&nbsp;package</li> <li><code>sudo apt-get remove package-name</code> - it&#8217;s obvious isn&#8217;t&nbsp;it?</li> <li><code>sudo apt-get update</code> - update package list. Note that it only updates the list, not the&nbsp;packages</li> <li><code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> - upgrade packages to their latest&nbsp;versions</li> </ul> <p>There will be programs that are not available on the official repositories, but are provided as package files (Dropbox for example). Remember that the right package format for Ubuntu is <code>.deb</code> files. Do not open <code>.rpm</code> files since they are for Fedora&#8217;s package manager called <code>yum</code>. When you&#8217;ve obtained the file, simply open it with Ubuntu Software Center to start&nbsp;installing.</p> <h2>Synaptic, Ubuntu Software&nbsp;Center</h2> <p>Aptitude is only a command-line program, which is not very user-friendly. Synaptic is a <span class="caps">GUI</span> program that provides a nice user interface that&#8217;s easy to use, while internally it uses <code>apt</code> to do all the actual&nbsp;work.</p> <p><img alt="Wget files" src="/images/wget-dependencies.png"></p> <p>Ubuntu Software Center is more than a <span class="caps">GUI</span> wrapper for <code>apt</code>. It is something similar to Apple&#8217;s appstore with all those program ratings and promotions. It&#8217;s nice for beginners but the fact that it hides the details like dependency list makes it undesirable for intermediate users. If you are comfortable with Synaptic, I strongly recommend using it as your main way to install/uninstall stuff. But ultimately, using the command-line <code>apt</code> always is the fastest&nbsp;way.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content --> </section> <footer id="contentinfo" class="body"> <address id="about" class="vcard body"> Proudly powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, which takes great advantage of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. </address><!-- /#about --> </footer><!-- /#contentinfo --> </body> </html>
