It&#8217;s probably fine, since even stock fonts seem to cover Vietnamese glyphs well these days. Otherwise, people who care enough to be bothered by fallback fonts are likely to know how to configure their browser with proper fonts&nbsp;anyway.</em></p> <p><em><strong>2017 Update</strong>: Now that I like high contrast more, I just updated the theme to a black/white/red palette with a [high-quality serif font][8] instead. Thanks [Mr.&nbsp;Butterick][9]!</em></p> <hr> I just redesigned my blog. To be totally honest, the previous design was not mine at all. I&#8217;ve always been using [pelican-octopress-theme][1], which is a Pelican port of the default theme for Octopress. It&#8217;s not that I have anything to complain about that theme: it was clean, readable and easy on the eyes. I just want my site to look unique. Content is king, sure, but it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to stand out from the crowd once in a while. I&#8217;m not a professional designer, but everything turned out quite well if I could say so. In this post I&#8217;ll explain my design goals and how I (hopefully) achieved them. ## Clean and lightweight The web is messy. I&#8217;m not talking blinking-marquee-fire-animated-header messy (thank god we&#8217;re done with that&#8230; [or are we?][2]). I&#8217;m talking megabytes-of-useless-javascript-and-css messy. For whatever reason, some people now think it&#8217;s cool to include Bootstrap/Foundation to every project, or to include that new shiny parallax library to ruin scrolling for everybody. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget the marvellous invention that is [&#8220;infinite scrolling&#8221;][3]: ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infinite_scrolling.png) In fact, the main motivation of my new theme is [this satire page][4] on the sad state of the web we&#8217;re in today. That&#8217;s why I decided to do no fancy cosmetic <span class="caps">JS</span> and try to keep my use of static assets to a minimum: ![](/images/mofo_01_loads.png) I guess there&#8217;s nothing I can do about the font files though, since I need to make sure my Vietnamese posts are rendered in a font that supports it. Oh well, at least it looks awesome. ## Content is king No more distracting sidebar with &#8220;latest news&#8221;, &#8220;related posts&#8221;, etc. with thumbnails popping up all over the place, just a good old article body from start to finish. ## Easy on the eye While [bettermotherfuckingwebsite][5] does a good job at demonstrating how far you can go with a few simple <span class="caps">CSS</span> rules (hint: very far), I found Tommi Kaikkonen&#8217;s [Interactive Guide to Blog Typography][6] much more comprehensive and informative. I implemented many of the ideas found in that guide: - Big body font - Constrained line width to aid reading - Generous line height, liberal whitespace to help with visual hierarchy - Lower background-foreground contrast. I also find the slightly yellow-ish background somewhat soothing. ## That&#8217;s it! You can find the source code to my theme [on GitHub][7]. I don&#8217;t recommend using it as-is though, since I haven&#8217;t implemented many required templates (authors, tags, categories, etc.) because I don&#8217;t use them. There&#8217;s also the hardcoded content in footer and probably a few more places. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll stop being lazy and fix all that. *Maybe*.
