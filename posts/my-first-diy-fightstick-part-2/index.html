To be honest I got lazy and paused the whole thing for a while, but yesterday I needed a distraction so&#8230; everything came together much more nicely than I&nbsp;thought!</p> <h2>I did&nbsp;it!</h2> <p>I was almost done in Part 1, except for the fact that button holes on the top panels didn&#8217;t align, and the topmost panel flexed a bit because of imprecise screw&nbsp;holes:</p> <p><img alt="Ewww" src="/images/fightstick_24_gap.jpg"></p> <p>To fix the button holes, I simply wrapped my roughest sandpaper around the drill bit and used it as a poor man&#8217;s sander to make the holes slightly bigger, just enough for buttons to fit. This took a while because the sandpaper pieces kept failing on me. Good thing I stock a huge roll in the first place!&nbsp;:-)</p> <p>The flexing panel was surprisingly trivial to fix: I simply made one corner&#8217;s hole a bit bigger to allow its screw to go all the way in properly. No more stupid&nbsp;gaps!</p> <p>Now that every piece was how it should be, the fun part began: assembling. The inside looked like&nbsp;this:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick2_01_wires.jpg"></p> <p>Notice the knot where the <span class="caps">USB</span> cable poked out? It was there as a safeguard against pulling so that the <span class="caps">PCB</span> doesn&#8217;t get yanked around. Later on I actually labeled every pair of wires for each button and secured the <span class="caps">PCB</span> better with more resilient tape, but I forgot to take photos and I&#8217;m now too lazy to open up the whole thing again so&#8230; you get the&nbsp;idea.</p> <p>As for the top panel artwork, I planned quite a few colored designs, but was too lazy to go to a printing shop. As luck would have it, I had a black and white printer at home, so I grabbed some random Galford image on the internet and printed out one sheet just to see how it would look. It turned out much better than expected so I kept it that&nbsp;way.</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick2_02_top.jpg"></p> <p>Note that I bought translucent buttons. These are worth the higher price tag because it is possible to take them apart and <a href="http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/25926/guide-how-to-put-art-under-clear-seimitsu-buttons">insert artwork pieces</a> under the cover. Just google custom fightsticks and you&#8217;ll find people making use of these buttons with <a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25628/2658140-photo+oct+04,+7+24+53+pm.jpg">stunning</a> <a href="http://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/custom-steampunk-fight-stick-by-sam-kurd-aka-b15sdm-designs.jpg">results</a>. But then again, I&#8217;m a lazy butt so my minimalistic design actually saved me from some tedious button modding. Maybe when I get better inspirations,&nbsp;maybe.</p> <p>Following the monochrome theme, the placeholder &#8220;Ken Flowchart&#8221; bottom piece from last post became official (I also trimmed the excess paper&nbsp;later):</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick_23_bottom.jpg"></p> <p>Oh, and here&#8217;s a front shot for completeness&#8217;&nbsp;sake:</p> <p><img alt src="/images/fightstick2_03_front.jpg"></p> <h2>Thoughts</h2> <p>All in all, this turned out much better than I expected. The whole thing feels solid to play with, and the plexiglass top panel makes a nice feeling palm rest. However, since I went a bit liberal on panel layers, it&#8217;s a tad heavier than my previous stick (which is already heavier than your average big brand sticks). On the flip side, I can be more aggressive with my joystick spinning sessions thanks to the extra&nbsp;weight.</p> <p>I&#8217;m also thinking of adding non-slip padding to the bottom. I almost exclusively play with the fightstick on my lap so it&#8217;s not actually necessary gameplay-wise, but without padding, the bottom screw heads stick out and would definitely scratch my table whenever I place the stick on it. Better be safe than&nbsp;sorry!</p> <p>That&#8217;s it! This project has been fun, and to me it served as an awesome gateway drug to the <span class="caps">DIY</span> world. Hopefully I inspired some of you to start your own projects too. Let me know how it&nbsp;goes!</p> </article> </div> <hr id="hr-comment"> <h2>Comments</h2> <div id="disqus_thread"> <button id="showCommentBtn">Show comments via Disqus</button> <noscript><br>(enable JavaScript first though)</noscript> </div> <script type="text/javascript">
