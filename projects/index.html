Why hello there, source viewer. Here's a dragon for no particular reason:

In some cases I even maintain them! Shocking, I&nbsp;know.</p> <h2>Pytaku</h2> <p><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~nhanb/pytaku">Pytaku</a> is a web-based manga reader that&#8217;s designed to be as self-host-friendly as possible. It&#8217;s an experiment to see how far I can get with a simpler toolset: basically just flask and sqlite (will most likely add mithril js into the mix soon). Still figuring stuff out as I&nbsp;go.</p> <h2><span class="caps">ORTS</span></h2> <p><a href="https://github.com/nhanb/orts/"><span class="caps">ORTS</span></a> is a <span class="caps">GUI</span> for operating scoreboards on fighting game&nbsp;streams.</p> <h2>An animated wallpaper for <span class="caps">KDE</span>&nbsp;Plasma</h2> <p>I was frustrated that <span class="caps">KDE</span> 5 didn&#8217;t allow animated gifs as wallpaper so I <a href="https://github.com/nhanb/com.nerdyweekly.animated">wrote one</a>. Every now and then someone would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/9sd5uy/kde_plasma_blur_gif_pixel_art_wallpaper_look/">use it on /r/unixporn</a> and cause a surge in github stars. It is currently my most starred repo, which gives me mixed&nbsp;feelings.</p> <h2>McRoss</h2> <p><a href="https://sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross">McRoss</a> is a minimal and usable <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini://</a> browser written in python and tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on any self-respecting desktop <span class="caps">OS</span>. Eventually Pytaku took most of my interest and time so it&#8217;s shelved for&nbsp;now.</p> <h2>Caophim</h2> <p><a href="https://github.com/nhanb/caophim">Caophim</a> is my take on imageboard software and also my excuse to try <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. There&#8217;s a usable live instance at <a href="https://caophim.net/">caophim.net</a>. It&#8217;s nowhere near my goals but to be honest I got tired of <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13531">running</a> <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/13986">into</a> <a href="https://github.com/pragmagic/karax/issues/143">nim&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/pragmagic/karax/issues/142">bugs</a>, in the compiler, the standard library, the flagship module that&#8217;s supposed to supersede a module in the standard library&#8230; you name it.
